      <description>I wanted to plot the yearly sales of three different types of hybrid and electric vehicles on the same graph. The dataset was originally wide with years as columns and the types of cars as rows. After cleaning the data (making it skinner by switching cars to columns and years to rows) and saving it to the name “ev_csv_3”, it was time to plot.
In order to have multiple y-axis lines, simply skip entering a y argument in the aes function in the first line of the ggplot call.</description>

      <description>Hi, I&amp;rsquo;m Nathania Johnson and I started this blog to write about data analysis and data science. I&amp;rsquo;m a new data witch, so please be patient with me as I learn to cast all sorts of spells across a variety of datasets.
Right now, I&amp;rsquo;m studying R, but plan to add python to my cauldron very soon.</description>
